         <h1>About me</h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Endijs, a 25-year-old aspiring web developer hailing from
        Latvia. <br />I'm currently on a journey of self-discovery and learning
        in the exciting world of web development.<br />
        As a beginner in this field, I may not have a wealth of professional
        experience to share with you just yet, <br />but what I lack in
        experience, I more than make up for in enthusiasm, dedication, and a
        hunger to learn.<br /><br />
        My fascination with web development ignited my desire to explore this
        dynamic and ever-evolving realm. <br />I've embarked on a learning
        adventure, immersing myself in the world of coding, design, and all
        things web-related.<br />
        This is where my story begins.<br /><br />
        I am committed to honing my skills and embracing the challenges that
        come my way.<br />
        While I may be a beginner, I believe that every project, every line of
        code, and every new skill I acquire<br />
        is a stepping stone towards my growth as a web developer. <br /><br />
        In this portfolio, you will find my humble beginnings, my projects, and
        my journey of progress.<br />
        It's a testimony to my determination to improve, my hunger for
        knowledge, and my dedication to this craft.<br /><br />
        I am thrilled to be on this path, and I welcome you to join me on my
        journey as I explore, create, and evolve<br />
        in the world of web development. Together, we can turn my aspirations
        into achievements.<br /><br />
        Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Feel free to reach out, share
        insights, or simply connect as I continue my learning adventure.
